# MarkDown notes
>
> Markdown (MD) is a text editing language, or formatting method, that improves upon a plain text editor's usefullness but is platform and program independant (i.e. Word docs need to be opened with a Word program, whereas a text file in MD can be opened in many different programs and operating systems (OS).) This is refered to as platform independant.
>
> Markdown's advantage over text editors is its ability to insert formating and some basic HTML functions that web browsers can convert into HTML. So why not just put your text directly into an HTML format? you could, but HTML is clunky to read smoothly and then only browsers could interpret it.
