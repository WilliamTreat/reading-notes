# HTML notes

> Learning to crawl...
>
> Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the starting point for all things internet. It begins the process of platform independance (IBM-DOS, Linix, apple-OS)
>
>The easyest way to get the initial starting boiler plate code is by using VS codes. Open a new file with *name*.html (extension needs to be **.html**). on first line, type ***!*** and use the autocomplete function (via tab key) and all the initial HTML code needed to begin a new web page is produced.
