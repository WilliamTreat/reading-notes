# Git and GitHub notes
>
>At the time of writing this, I've made the same mistakes repeatedly. In this tutorial, there is the assuption that you are doing this stuff for the first time and if thats not true, you need to skip the *Git init* step, and realise that the *git clone* command will make a directory in your currently active directory (i was in notes dir, cloned from github, and it makes a sub directory within notes called notes and now I have two copies of everything and notes in notes).

> Also I'm using different computers on different days so before cloning from git to one of my locals, i need to remove the directory and files within it. cd to directory above where your working and use *rm -r* and directory name. Use *ls -a* and *pwd* and *tree* often to ensure you know whats going on. Then clone down to that days computer and git will make the directory anew with all the current files.
